# hubot-chat — Design Document (DESIGN_DOC.md)
Version: v0.7
Date: 2026-01-19
Author: Joey Guerra

Core principle:
Keep third-party dependencies to an absolute minimum.
If we can code it ourselves, we do.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

0. One-Sentence Concept

hubot-chat is a chat application you can spin up instantly with:

npx hubot-chat --port 3000

to host a private, ephemeral conversation with a small group—where
Hubot is the system and chat is the UI.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Product Intent

Hubot has existed since 2013, but it typically lives inside other chat
systems (Slack, Discord, etc.).

This project flips that relationship.

hubot-chat is the chat app where Hubot is native.

Primary job-to-be-done:

“I want to start up a private instance of chat so I can have an
ephemeral conversation with some people.”

Goals:
- Zero-friction startup (npm install + npx)
- No auth or external services required
- Multiple rooms (public + private) on day one
- Hubot always running, always receiving messages
- Persistence is optional and layered
- Works well for local, private, ad-hoc conversations

Explicit Non-Goals (Layer 0):
- OAuth / SSO
- Role-based permissions
- Threads, reactions, unread counts
- File uploads
- Multi-node clustering
- Enterprise moderation workflows

---------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Default Behavior

Default Run Mode:

npx hubot-chat --port 3000

- Single Node.js process
- In-memory only
- Unlimited message history until restart
- Nickname-based identity
- Nickname stored in browser localStorage
- Multiple rooms (public + private)
- Hubot runtime always on
- Hubot receives all messages
- Vanilla HTML + CSS + JS UI
- Realtime via WebSockets

Optional Persistence:

npx hubot-chat --port 3000 --persist ./data/chat.sqlite

- Uses Node’s native SQLite module
- SQLite tables are insert-only
- In-memory state remains authoritative
- Persistence is asynchronous and ordered

---------------------------------------------------------------------

3. User Stories (Jobs-To-Be-Done)

1. As a builder, I want to spin up a private chat instance quickly so I
   can gather people for an ephemeral conversation.

2. As a new user, I want to choose a nickname and start chatting
   immediately without creating an account.

3. As a host, I want to create private rooms so conversations don’t
   collide.

4. As a host, I want to invite someone with a link so onboarding is
   frictionless.

5. As a host, I want invite links to be safe by default (single-use +
   time-limited).

6. As a participant, I want Hubot present in the room so automation can
   participate naturally.

7. As a returning browser user, I want my nickname remembered locally.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Core Concepts (“Atoms”)

Session
- sessionId
- nickname
- createdAt

Room
- roomId
- name
- visibility: public | private
- createdAt
- createdBySessionId
- dm rooms use name prefix: dm:{nicknameA},{nicknameB}

Membership
- roomId
- sessionId
- joinedAt

Message
- messageId
- roomId
- sessionId
- nickname
- text
- createdAt

Invite
- inviteId
- roomId
- tokenHash
- createdAt
- expiresAt

Invariants:
- Messages are immutable
- Membership changes are append-only events
- Invites expire after first successful use
- Invites expire after 24 hours by default
- Server timestamps are authoritative
- DM rooms are private and only visible to their members

---------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Room Model

Public Rooms:
- Visible to all users
- Anyone may join

Private Rooms:
- Visible only to members
- Joined via invite link
- Nickname-based (no auth)
- Intended for ad-hoc, ephemeral groups

Direct Message Rooms:
- Created when a user starts a DM by nickname
- Only contains the two participants
- Uses a private room with a dm: name prefix
- No invites required

Room Discovery Rules:
- Show all public rooms
- Show only private rooms user belongs to
- Do not show locked or placeholder rooms

---------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Invites

Properties:
- Single-use
- Expire after first successful join
- Expire after 24 hours by default

Flow:
1. Host creates private room
2. System generates invite token
3. Invite link is shared
4. First successful join consumes invite
5. Any further attempts fail

Direct Message Flow:
1. User searches for a nickname
2. System creates or reuses a dm room
3. Sender is auto-joined
4. Recipient sees the DM room in the list with an unread indicator

---------------------------------------------------------------------

7. UI Specification (Vanilla)

Layout:

[ Rooms Sidebar ] [ Active Room Messages ]
[ + New Room ]
[ Message Input ]

Additional UI (Direct Messages):

[ Direct message ] button
[ Search by nickname ] modal

Characteristics:
- No unread counts
- No threads
- No reactions
- No rich formatting
- Fast and boring by design
- Direct messages are just private rooms
- DM search lists currently connected users only
- DM rooms show a blue unread dot when new messages arrive

---------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Transport Protocol (WebSocket)

Client to Server:
- hello { nickname }
- hello { nickname, sessionId }
- room.create { name, visibility }
- room.join { roomId }
- room.joinByInvite { inviteToken }
- message.send { roomId, text }
- dm.start { nickname }

Server to Client:
- state.init
- room.created
- room.joined
- message.new
- user.joined
- user.left
- error

---------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Hubot Integration

Core stance:
hubot-chat does not implement addressing rules.

All accepted messages are forwarded to the Hubot Robot.
Hubot scripts decide whether they hear or respond.

Behavior:
- Hubot runs in-process
- All messages forwarded to robot.receive()
- Hubot output becomes chat messages from:
  sessionId: hubot
  nickname: hubot

Script loading:
- Use Hubot external_scripts.json
- Default path: ./external_scripts.json
- Override via --scripts

---------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Persistence (--persist)

Goals:
- Insert-only
- Preserve hot-path performance
- No blocking on disk I/O
- Recover state on restart

Strategy:
- In-memory state is authoritative
- SQLite used as append-only event log
- Writes occur asynchronously

Tables:
- rooms
- memberships (append-only)
- messages (append-only)
- invites
- invite_events (append-only)

Invite validity:
- created event exists
- no consumed event
- current time < expires_ts

---------------------------------------------------------------------

11. CLI Interface

npx hubot-chat --port 3000
npx hubot-chat --port 3000 --persist ./data/chat.sqlite
npx hubot-chat --scripts ./external_scripts.json
npx hubot-chat --invite-ttl-hours 24

Session Restore
- Client stores sessionId in localStorage
- Client sends sessionId on hello
- Server reuses session and memberships if present

---------------------------------------------------------------------

12. XP-Style Implementation Slices

1. WebSocket connect → nickname → messaging
2. Multiple rooms + switching
3. Private rooms + invite join
4. Direct messages by nickname
5. Hubot runtime + adapter
6. SQLite persistence (--persist)

Each slice must produce a usable system.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

13. Guiding Philosophy

- Start boring
- Keep the hot path in memory
- Make every capability a layer
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Let Hubot remain Hubot

hubot-chat is not Slack.
It is the simplest chat substrate where Hubot is finally at home.

14. Copilot / Codex Build Prompt

Context

You are building hubot-chat, a minimal chat application in Node.js where Hubot is the system and chat is the UI.

Core constraints:
	•	Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only (no frameworks)
	•	Keep third-party dependencies to an absolute minimum
	•	If something can reasonably be coded, code it instead of installing a package
	•	Single Node.js process
	•	WebSocket-based realtime messaging
	•	Hubot runs in-process and receives all messages

⸻

🎯 Objective

Implement Layer 0 of hubot-chat:
	•	npx hubot-chat --port 3000 starts a chat server
	•	Users join by choosing a nickname (stored in localStorage)
	•	Multiple rooms exist on day one (public + private)
	•	Private rooms are joined via single-use invite links
	•	Invite links expire after first use or after 24 hours
	•	Users see:
	•	all public rooms
	•	only private rooms they are members of
	•	DM rooms for one-to-one chats
	•	Unlimited message history in memory until restart
	•	Optional persistence via --persist <sqlite path>
	•	Hubot is always running and receives all messages
	•	Hubot scripts decide what to hear/respond to

⸻

🧠 Architectural Decisions (Do Not Change)
	•	Chat server is the Hubot runtime
	•	Chat messages are forwarded to robot.receive() unconditionally
	•	Hubot output is rendered as chat messages from:
	•	sessionId: "hubot"
	•	nickname: "hubot"
	•	No addressing logic in chat layer
	•	No auth, roles, permissions, or enterprise features
	•	DMs are implemented as private rooms

⸻

🧩 Core Domain Concepts

Implement these in-memory structures:
	•	Session { sessionId, nickname, createdAt }
	•	Room { roomId, name, visibility, createdAt, createdBySessionId }
	•	Membership { roomId, sessionId, joinedAt }
	•	Message { messageId, roomId, sessionId, nickname, text, createdAt }
	•	Invite { inviteId, roomId, tokenHash, expiresAt }
	•	DirectMessageRoom { roomId, name, sessionIdA, sessionIdB }

Rules:
	•	Messages are immutable
	•	Membership changes are append-only
	•	Invites are single-use and time-limited
	•	Server timestamps are authoritative

⸻

🔌 WebSocket Protocol

Client → Server
	•	hello { nickname }
	•	hello { nickname, sessionId }
	•	room.create { name, visibility }
	•	room.join { roomId }
	•	room.joinByInvite { inviteToken }
	•	message.send { roomId, text }
	•	dm.start { nickname }

Server → Client
	•	state.init
	•	room.created
	•	room.joined
	•	message.new
	•	user.joined
	•	user.left
	•	error

⸻

🖥️ UI Requirements (Vanilla)
- Mobile first
- Responsive design
- Left sidebar: room list
- Main area: messages for active room
- Bottom input: send message
- Room list UX:
- Click to switch rooms
- Public rooms auto-join on click
- Private rooms visible only if member
- “+ New room” button
- “Direct message” button
- DM search modal by nickname
- No unread counts, no threads, no reactions

⸻

🔒 Private Room + Invite Logic
	•	Private rooms require invite token
	•	Invite link:
	•	single-use
	•	expires after first successful join
	•	expires after 24 hours by default
	•	After successful join:
	•	invite is immediately consumed
	•	room appears in user’s room list

💬 Direct Messages
	•	Users can start a DM by nickname
	•	DM creates a private room with two members
	•	Only connected users are discoverable
	•	Recipient is not auto-joined
	•	Recipient sees a blue unread dot until opening the DM

⸻

🤖 Hubot Integration
	•	Run Hubot in-process
	•	Load scripts using Hubot external_scripts.json
	•	Forward all accepted messages to robot.receive()
	•	Convert Hubot output into chat messages
	•	Do not implement command routing or filtering

⸻

💾 Optional Persistence (--persist)
	•	Use Node’s native SQLite module
	•	Insert-only tables
	•	In-memory state is authoritative
	•	Async persistence only (never block message delivery)

Tables:
	•	rooms
	•	memberships (append-only)
	•	messages (append-only)
	•	invites
	•	invite_events (created | consumed)

Invite validity:
	•	created event exists
	•	no consumed event
	•	now < expires_ts

⸻

🛠️ CLI Interface

Support:
	•	--port <number>
	•	--persist <sqlite path>
	•	--scripts <external_scripts.json path>
	•	--invite-ttl-hours <number> (default 24)

⸻

🧪 Implementation Guidance
	•	Build in thin vertical slices
	•	Start with:
	1.	WebSocket connect → nickname → lobby messaging
	2.	Multiple rooms
	3.	Private rooms + invites
	4.	Direct messages by nickname
	5.	Hubot adapter
	6.	SQLite persistence
	•	Prefer clarity over cleverness
	•	Write code that is easy to debug

⸻

🚫 Explicitly Do NOT Implement
	•	OAuth / SSO
	•	Permissions
	•	Notifications
	•	Threads
	•	Reactions
	•	Presence indicators
	•	Frontend frameworks
	•	Large dependency trees

⸻

Private Rooms
Enable a user who joins a private room with an invite to refresh and still participate by restoring their sessionId.

🧭 Philosophy

hubot-chat is not Slack.
It is the simplest chat substrate where Hubot is finally at home.

Build accordingly.
